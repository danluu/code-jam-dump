Formats of manpage:
ls: list of options after DESCRIPTION, has - or --
dd: list of options after DESCRIPTION, no - or --. Additionally, has list of suboptions for argument.
chmod: explains something (MODE) in DESCRIPTION, options under OPTIONS.
cp: list of options with - or -- after DESCRIPTION. One option contains [=CONTROL], which is expanded on later, but without explicitly saying that it's CONTROL.
ln: also uses CONTROL, like cp. Has the exact same set of options and the same explanation that doesn't explicitly reference CONTROL

x86_64: actually a subcommand of setarch. Has options that are similar to if not identical to i386.
