       --output[=FIELD_LIST]
              use the output format defined by FIELD_LIST, or print all fields
              if FIELD_LIST is omitted.
tail:
       -z, --zero-terminated
              line delimiter is NUL, not newlines
top:
       -o  :Override-sort-field as:  -o fieldname
            Specifies  the  name  of  the  field  on  which tasks will be
            sorted, independent of what is reflected in the configuration
            file.  You can prepend a `+' or `-' to the field name to also
            override the  sort  direction.   A  leading  `+'  will  force
            sorting  high to low, whereas a `-' will ensure a low to high
            ordering.

            This option exists primarily  to  support  automated/scripted
            batch mode operation.

       -O  :Output-field-names
            This  option  acts as a form of help for the above -o option.
            It will cause top to print each of the available field  names
            on a separate line, then quit.  Such names are subject to nls
            translation.

      -w  :Output-width-override as:  -w [ number ]
            In Batch mode, when used without an argument top will  format
            output  using  the COLUMNS= and LINES= environment variables,
            if set.  Otherwise, width will be fixed at  the  maximum  512
            columns.   With an argument, output width can be decreased or
            increased (up to 512) but the number of  rows  is  considered
            unlimited.

            In  normal  display  mode,  when used without an argument top
            will attempt to format output using the COLUMNS=  and  LINES=
            environment  variables,  if  set.   With  an argument, output
            width can only be decreased, not  increased.   Whether  using
            environment  variables  or  an  argument with -w, when not in
            Batch mode actual terminal dimensions can never be exceeded.

            Note: Without the use of  this  command-line  option,  output
            width  is  always  based  on  the  terminal  at which top was
            invoked whether or not in Batch mode.	    
tar: (not a complete list)
       --hole-detection=METHOD
              Use METHOD to detect holes in sparse files.  This  option
              implies  --sparse.   Valid values for METHOD are seek and
              raw.  Default is seek  with  fallback  to  raw  when  not
              applicable.

   Extended file attributes
       --acls Enable POSIX ACLs support.

       --no-acls
              Disable POSIX ACLs support.

       --selinux
              Enable SELinux context support.

       --no-selinux
              Disable SELinux context support.

       --xattrs
              Enable extended attributes support.

       --no-xattrs
              Disable extended attributes support.

       --xattrs-exclude=PATTERN
              Specify the exclude pattern for xattr keys.  PATTERN is a
              POSIX regular expression, e.g. --xattrs-exclude='^user.',
              to exclude attributes from the user namespace.

       --xattrs-include=PATTERN
              Specify the include pattern for xattr keys.  PATTERN is a
              POSIX regular expression.
ping:
       -a     Audible ping.

       -A     Adaptive  ping.  Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time,
              so that effectively not more than one (or more,  if  preload  is
              set)  unanswered  probe  is  present  in  the  network.  Minimal
              interval is 200msec for not super-user.  On  networks  with  low
              rtt this mode is essentially equivalent to flood mode.

       -b     Allow pinging a broadcast address.

       -B     Do  not  allow  ping  to  change  source address of probes.  The
              address is bound to one selected when ping starts.

       -D     Print  timestamp  (unix  time + microseconds as in gettimeofday)
              before each line.	      

       -F flow label
              ping6 only.  Allocate and set 20 bit flow label (in hex) on echo
              request packets.  If value is zero, kernel allocates random flow
              label.

       -I interface
              interface  is  either  an  address,  or  an  interface name.  If
              interface is an address, it sets  source  address  to  specified
              interface  address.   If interface in an interface name, it sets
              source interface to specified interface.  For ping6, when  doing
              ping  to  a link-local scope address, link specification (by the
              '%'-notation in destination, or by this option) is required.

   -L     Suppress loopback of multicast packets.  This flag only  applies
              if the ping destination is a multicast address.

       -m mark
              use  mark  to  tag  the  packets  going  out. This is useful for
              variety of reasons  within  the  kernel  such  as  using  policy
              routing to select specific outbound processing.

       -M pmtudisc_opt
              Select  Path  MTU  Discovery  strategy.   pmtudisc_option may be
              either do (prohibit fragmentation, even  local  one),  want  (do
              PMTU  discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large), or
              dont (do not set DF flag).

       -N nodeinfo_option
              ping6 only.  Send ICMPv6  Node  Information  Queries  (RFC4620),
              instead of Echo Request.  CAP_NET_RAW capability is required.

              help   Show help for NI support.

              name   Queries for Node Names.

              ipv6   Queries  for  IPv6  Addresses.  There  are  several  IPv6
                     specific flags.

                     ipv6-global
                            Request IPv6 global-scope addresses.

                     ipv6-sitelocal
                            Request IPv6 site-local addresses.

                     ipv6-linklocal
                            Request IPv6 link-local addresses.

                     ipv6-all
                            Request IPv6 addresses on other interfaces.

              ipv4   Queries for IPv4 Addresses.  There is one  IPv4  specific
                     flag.

                     ipv4-all
                            Request IPv4 addresses on other interfaces.

              subject-ipv6=ipv6addr
                     IPv6 subject address.

              subject-ipv4=ipv4addr
                     IPv4 subject address.

              subject-name=nodename
                     Subject  name.   If it contains more than one dot, fully-
                     qualified domain name is assumed.

              subject-fqdn=nodename
                     Subject name.   Fully-qualified  domain  name  is  always
                     assumed.

       -O     Report outstanding ICMP ECHO reply before sending  next  packet.
              This is useful together with the timestamp -D to log output to a
              diagnostic file and search for missing answers.

       -Q tos Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams.  tos can
              be decimal (ping only) or hex number.

              In RFC2474, these fields are interpreted as 8-bit Differentiated
              Services (DS), consisting  of:  bits  0-1  (2  lowest  bits)  of
              separate  data,  and bits 2-7 (highest 6 bits) of Differentiated
              Services Codepoint (DSCP).  In RFC2481 and RFC3168, bits 0-1 are
              used for ECN.

              Historically   (RFC1349,   obsoleted  by  RFC2474),  these  were
              interpreted as: bit 0 (lowest bit) for reserved (currently being
              redefined  as  congestion  control), 1-4 for Type of Service and
              bits 5-7 (highest bits) for Precedence.

   -S sndbuf
              Set  socket  sndbuf.  If not specified, it is selected to buffer
              not more than one packet.

       -t ttl ping only.  Set the IP Time to Live.

       -T timestamp option
              Set special IP  timestamp  options.   timestamp  option  may  be
              either  tsonly  (only  timestamps),  tsandaddr  (timestamps  and
              addresses) or tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]] (timestamp
              prespecified hops).

       -U     Print  full  user-to-user  latency (the old behaviour). Normally
              ping prints network round trip time, which can be different f.e.
              due to DNS failures.


       -V     Show version and exit.

       -w deadline
              Specify  a  timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of
              how many packets have been sent or received. In this  case  ping
              does  not  stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for
              deadline expire or until count probes are answered or  for  some
              error notification from network.

       -W timeout
              Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The option affects only
              timeout in absence of any responses, otherwise  ping  waits  for
              two RTTs.
sudo:
removed:
       -D level    Enable debugging of sudo plugins and sudo itself.  The
                   level may be a value from 1 through 9.
added:
     -h host, --host=host
                 Run the command on the specified host if the security policy
                 plugin supports remote commands.  Note that the sudoers
                 plugin does not currently support running remote commands.
                 This may also be used in conjunction with the -l option to
                 list a user's privileges for the remote host.

     -r role, --role=role
                 Run the command with an SELinux security context that
                 includes the specified role.





Note: kill is considered to have 3 options, although you can send many signals to kill.

Similarly, tar has 139 option flags if you count options for options as a single option. For example, --warning has 25 options, but this was considered one option for the purposes of this post because those are all suboptions of `--warning`.

~~~
       --warning=KEYWORD
              Enable or disable warning messages identified by KEYWORD.  The messages are suppressed if KEYWORD is prefixed with no- and enabled otherwise.

                     Controls  verbose  description of failures occurring when trying to run alternative decompressor programs.  This warning is disabled by default (unless --verbose is used).  A common example of what you can get when using this warning
                     is:

                     $ tar --warning=decompress-program -x -f archive.Z

                     tar (child): trying gzip

Environment variables were also not included, e.g., man is considered to have one option (`-k`), and the following "options" to `man` weren't counted as options:

~~~
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of man:

       LANG      Provide   a   default   value  for  the  internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the  Base  Definitions
                 volume  of  POSIX.1‐2008,  Section  8.2, Internationalization
                 Variables  for   the   precedence   of   internationalization
                 variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If  set  to  a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of  sequences  of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to multi-byte characters  in  arguments  and  in  the
                 summary  database). The value of LC_CTYPE need not affect the
                 format of the information written about the name operands.

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error
                 and informative messages written to standard output.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing
                 of LC_MESSAGES.

       PAGER     Determine  an output filtering command for writing the output
                 to a terminal. Any  string  acceptable  as  a  command_string
                 operand  to  the  sh �−c command shall be valid. When standard
                 output is a terminal device, the reference page output  shall
                 be  piped  through the command. If the PAGER variable is null
                 or not set, the command  shall  be  either  more  or  another
                 paginator utility documented in the system documentation.
